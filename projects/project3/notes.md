**************************** GRID BASED MOVEMENT ***************************
This text file is for my notes/brainstorming/to-do list.

Prototype 1: Grid Based Movement

Starting Questions
1) What is grid-based movement?
its movement on a grid, which is based on the dimensions of each tile.

2) What size is my grid going to be?
games move up by 8 which is weird but ok. i guess i'll try 16x16 since 8x8 seems
excessively small.

3) What are my goals for this?
submit this on time lol
ok but actually i want to...

* be able to move a "character" (lets be real, its
going to be a box) around the screen in increments of 16 so that it adheres to
the grid.

* create collisions that function properly

* let some kinda dialog box open when pressing a key to interact with another
  character

* put objects to collide with into an array

ok thats good for now or im going to die

************************** TO-DO LIST ********************

1) figure out canvas size
okay so its gotta be some product of 16, gonna just multiply numbers on google
real quick...

width: 800
height: 512

nice, these are both multiples of 16.

2) draw a grid onscreen so i can see if my "character" is actually moving by
    grid increments

i did it, and, it hurts to look at
heres the example i followed, i, dont really understand how it works:
