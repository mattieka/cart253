1) Improve the game by tracking the score (add a property to each paddle to
store its score in, and add an if statement in handleBallOffScreen() that
checks which side of the screen it went off and updates the appropriate paddle's
score) - DONE


2) Improve the game by displaying the score on the screen, but without using
text (e.g. change the colour of the paddle based on its score, or its size, or
its maxSpeed, or anything else). Add a function to handle this.  - DONE


3) Improve the game by making the ball launch toward the paddle that won the
most recent point with a random y velocity (e.g. if it went off the left side
of the screen it should launch toward the righthand side with a random y
velocity). Make sure you keep your random y velocity within a range that makes
the game still interesting to play (e.g. not too high and not too low)).
Add a reset() function to handle this. - DONE

4) Improve the game by making it visually and sonically interesting in some way
(e.g. you could make it a metaphor by using images and sounds to convey an idea,
or you could keep it abstract but use more interesting shapes, perhaps allow
things to leave a trail, perhaps fill the paddles and balls with randomly
generated "static", or something else) - DONE

Optional challenges: Add a win condition that ends the game. - DONE

 Allow the paddles
to move on the x axis. Make the ball move on y with a sine wave or perlin noise.
 Use the relative position the ball hits a paddle to influence its resulting y
 velocity (e.g. hitting the ball off the edge might give it a sharper angle).
 Allow paddles to also shoot a "bullet" at each other which destroys whatever
 it touches.
