INSTRUCTIONS

This week, the challenge is to recreate your Exercise-4 version of Pong
in the new Object-Oriented version of Pong represented by the starter code.
This will mean:

Tracking the score
(consider the idea of having the Ball's isOffScreen() function either return
which side of the screen it went off, or neither if it's still on screen -
you could represent this with numbers or strings) - DONE

Displaying the score - DONE

Launching the ball with a random y velocity toward the paddle that won the most
recent point - DONE

Altering the visuals as per your previous version - DONE 


In short, make the object-oriented version look and feel the same as the
non-object-oriented version you made last week.

Optional challenges: Feel free to pursue last week's optional challenges in this
new context.
